you can get dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/mukhtarkassar/eyes-images
to dection sleep using deeplreaning (CNN or NN) using python 
1-code train dection sleep.py to train data and save models. 
2-file SleepingWithCNN.py using CNN after traing data to dection drowsiness :
  It checks if the person is asleep for 15 seconds
  He will divide the number of eye closures during this period, he will make a sound, otherwise he will be examined after two minutes
3-file SleepingWithŸêANN.py using ANN after traing data to dection drowsiness :
  It checks if the person is asleep for 15 seconds
  He will divide the number of eye closures during this period, he will make a sound, otherwise he will be examined after two minutes
4-file SleepingWithCNN1.py using CNN after traing data to dection drowsiness :
It checks if the person is asleep for ++ seconds
He will divide the number of eye closures during this period, he will make a sound with a re-examination until someone wakes up, otherwise he checks back after two minutes


Knowing that I am a person who closes his eyes 10 times a minute. That is equivalent to times a 15 secound
